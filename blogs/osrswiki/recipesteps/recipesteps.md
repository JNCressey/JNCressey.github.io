# recipe steps profit comparison table for old school RuneScape wiki

Many items have multiple steps in their creation. I noticed that the information for each of the steps was often spread across multiple articles - each item's article having the details of the final step that creates it. 

I decided I would make a table to collect the information together.

At first I was unsure which information should be included in the table. If it misses something essential, then people will still need to go to multiple pages. But, if it contains all the information then it would be too cluttered.

## designs I tried

### design 1

### Design 3

### Design 4

I decided that, for simply explaining the steps involving partialy-made items that aren't traded, the tables of the previous designs would be too cluttered and unnecessary compared to the already existing `Instructions` template which simply lists a sentence of what to do for each step.

To be useful, the table should compare the profits made by performing each step of creation.

### Design 6

I didn't quite like how I was displaying the requirements for a step.

The fact that those cells ocupyed the same space vertically as the items caused a few problems:
* It seems too cluttered and it would be confusing to add headings for the various requirement fields.
* It was also difficult to get the cells to equally share the width. It involved adding a could of pretend column for spacing, where the item rows and requirement rows would merge different columns. It would also be confusing to other people trying to edit the table.

So I decided to move the requirements into a combined list in a large cell to the side.

### Design 7

I didn't quite like how the labels for the step numbers were occupying a column contributing to the horizontal width. So, for the final design, I decided to move the step numbers to be as header rows.

With them as header rows, I could also have space to give titles to the steps. So, I decided to put the image and name of the product of a step in its header.
