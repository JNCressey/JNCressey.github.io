# recipe steps profit comparison table for old school RuneScape wiki

Many items have multiple steps in their creation. I noticed that the information for each of the steps was often spread across multiple articles - each item's article having the details of the final step that creates it. 

I decided I would make a table to collect the information together.

At first I was unsure which information should be included in the table. If it misses something essential, then people will still need to go to multiple pages. But, if it contains all the information then it would be too cluttered.

## designs I tried

### design 1

### design 2

### Design 3

### Design 4

I decided that, for simply explaining the steps involving partialy-made items that aren't traded, the tables of the previous designs would be too cluttered and unnecessary compared to the already existing `Instructions` template which simply lists a sentence of what to do for each step.

To be useful, the table should compare the profits made by performing each step of creation.
