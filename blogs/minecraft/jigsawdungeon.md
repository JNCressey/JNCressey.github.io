# A datapack for minecraft to generate randomised dungeons 

My repo: https://github.com/JNCressey/jnc-minecraft-datapack-jigsaw-dungeon

I made a randomised generating dungeon using the jigsaw blocks.

Since designing them, it has become possible to add jigsaw based stuctures to the world generation via datapacks. (todo: implement the dungeons as a datapack)
